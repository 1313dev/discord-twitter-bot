## Setup 
* The bot is written in Python3 and requires tweepy.   
* Create a data.json file by executing setupBot.py.
* There it will ask for Twitter API keys&secret as well as access token&secret. You can get it [here](https://apps.twitter.com/).
* You need a Discord Webhook URL. See [this intro](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks) for a detailed explanation.  
* Lastly it will ask for Twitter IDs. Use [this site](http://gettwitterid.com/).  
* Finally you can just start main.py and it will start posting in your Discord channel when there are new tweets.
